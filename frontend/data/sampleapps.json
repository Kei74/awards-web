            "question": "Choose one or more scenes from any anime and analyze different aspects of their visual production based on the categories above. (Good Answer)",
            "answer": "Perhaps one of the most iconic opening scenes in film comes from Star Wars: A New Hope. The film takes place in an unusual setting, and features very little exposition, so this opening scene needs to convey quite a bit with only visuals. The film uses many visual tools to establish various elements quickly to the audience without being intrusive or getting in the way of the action. \r\n\r\nOne of the most notable ways that Star Wars conveys information is through how its characters are designed. The rebels are depicted with their faces revealed, which immediately makes them more sympathetic to the audience than the faceless stormtroopers. The designs of C3PO and R2D2 also prepare the audience for some of the more unconventional designs. While R2D2 has nothing resembling human features, C3PO's face makes him immediately more relatable to the audience, and his association with R2 establishes the presence of unusual characters disconnected from being The stormtroopers, on the other hand, are all uniform and dehumanized, with their helmet's \"face\" forced into an unusual frown, and appearing excessively clean. This is a heavy contrast with C3PO and R2, who appear to be somewhat used, covered in a layer of grime.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThis is a good writeup that analyzes the scenes in question well and brings in the relevant categories when needed. It could use a bit more examples and perhaps more in depth analysis other than \u201Cfaceless clean stormtrooper\u201D contrasted with the main characters."

            "question": "Several aspects can go into making an anime opening or ending great. Analyze how two (or more) OPs or EDs excel at different aspects. (Good Answer)",
            "answer": "I tend to care the most about interesting visuals and\/or good cohesion between the visuals\/song or the OP and the show.\r\n \r\n[Transformers G1 season 2](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yo45xY6K8zE) has some amazing visuals, especially for its time. We start out with the logo (i.e. the transformers) flying from a technological city-planet to a prehistoric earth (signified by the volcano erupting) already keying us in that the transformers reached earth from their home planet in prehistoric times. This is shown beautifully by a near-continuous shot past their planet, zooming into earth, and having a volcano spit out the logo. It's both interesting visually and tells the basic premise of the story effectively.\r\nWe then transition into action scenes via the logo being literally bitten by a robot dinosaur which then transitions into modern vehicle\/weapon robots. This again signifies that the autobots and decepticons have been fighting throughout time, from the dinosaur age into modern times. The entire OP is filled with these sorts of examples that tell you what the show is about just from the visuals.\r\n \r\nMeanwhile, let's contrast this with the [Ducktales opening](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nqZ_Cb2slBw). The visuals here aren't amazing, since they are just random shots from the show. But the music manages to sell the entire show. The song is some upbeat jazz filled with style telling us that, all things considered, this is a very lighthearted show. The lyrics themselves are simple, but does the show justice while also having stupid puns that add to the charm. While the visuals by themselves don't do much, they mesh well with the song.\r\nWe move into a more \"serious\" segment with danger lurking behind and so on, which tells the viewers that despite its lightheartedness, Ducktales has *some* spook. While not being spectacular, the song, lyrics, and visuals have great cohesion and meshes well with what we expect the show to be.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThis application manages to successfully answer the prompt and provide specific examples of details from each OP. This is a good application, but could go more into detail on certain aspects (e.g. how do the visuals of the Ducktales OP mesh well with the song, and more analysis of the Transformers OP)."

            "question": "Name an anime you enjoyed that is not in your favorite genre(s). What made it stand out? (Good Answer)",
            "answer": "I typically very much dislike zombie movies. They are usually uninteresting, have either zero or boring drama, no proper villains (zombie or Evil McGee), and the action consists of \"shoot these slow\/fast moving mindless dudes\".\r\n\r\nSo when Shaun of the Dead managed to be a *good* zombie movie, imagine my surprise. So what makes it so much better? Well first of all, it's a comedy. In this day and age, zombies have automatically gotten silly. You can't really craft a proper serious story around them. You *need* goof. This is the most important part. SotD is funny and manages to take something as silly as zombies and keep it silly.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, the drama isn't another shitty \"humans were the real monsters all along\". The zombies remain the main antagonists, but the drama is still surrounding humans. This is also accentuated by the characters actually being properly, you know, characterized and developed so the drama feels like a natural part of the show instead of something forced. The zombie invasion actually adds to it as that is what causes the characters enough stress to start dealing with their built-up issues.\r\n\r\nHumor, proper drama, and no terrible morals is what makes SotD superior to regular zombie flicks.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nA short answer while still well-organized and concise. Answers each part of the question (why they don't like zombie movies and why this movie is an exception). Their argument\u2019s biggest defenses (humor, proper drama, and morals) line up with their reasons for not normally enjoying the genre (boring, barely any drama, and predictable morales\/themes). Actual examples defending their claims made would have pushed this writeup to a 4."

            "question": "Give an example of a poorly-written anime character, and what changes you would make to improve them. (Good Answer)",
            "answer": "Bran from Game of Thrones stands out among the rest of the cast to me as a flat and unengaging character (at least in the show). There are times in fiction when a one-dimensional and static character is appropriate, especially for lesser roles and comedic ones. Bran, however, is at the center of one of the most important narratives of the show. While little time may be spent on it relatively, Bran\u2019s transformation from a crippled child to the Three-eyed Raven is very important in terms of the show\u2019s lore, and later conflicts. Unfortunately, it\u2019s entirely carried by the active danger Bran is in at a given moment. If there are no incestuous relatives or undead monsters after him, he\u2019s merely a boy who barely emotes, and whose personality and internal conflicts we see almost none of, though they must surely exist. Bran being called to eventually inherit his power has the potential to be a harrowing and deeply intriguing small-scale conflict in the show, but it\u2019s hampered by what I would term poor character writing.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I would start by giving Bran a little more screentime, as it\u2019s certainly hard to squeeze in more characterizing moments when his scenes are so few and far between as it is. Secondly and perhaps most importantly, I would give Bran clear personality traits so he\u2019s more likeable.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThis is a generally solid writeup that details what the character\u2019s issues are and explains how to make them better. To reach a 4, we would need a more detailed explanation on how to improve the character with perhaps examples on how said improvement would appear in the show itself."

            "question": "Describe how an anime's OST, Sound Design, and/or Voice Acting can modify/elevate the emotional impact of a scene. Elaborate using one or more examples. (Good Answer)",
            "answer": "The Conversation is probably one of the more famous examples of excellent sound design in film, with Robert Mulch having free reign over a lot of what happened in this movie. The film uses a great deal of diegetic sound in order to get the viewer in the mindset of the main character of Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who frequently uses wiretaps in order to record others. \r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the scenes that best represents this is [the listening scene] (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mlBXlDh3dCg) , where he repeatedly listens to a scene to try to filter a recorded conversation. The scene uses noises from the recording equipment in order to craft a large amount of its soundscape, with the various noises creating a sort of rhythm in the scene. The audio patterns show Harry Caul's incremental progress in filtering out the conversation, with the audio from the clip gradually building before getting much quieter for the reveal of the distorted voiceline's meaning. The brief sentence that Harry discovers drives the rest of the movie. Most of the audio is diegetic, but the drumming helps show Harry Caul finding the truth. The only non-diegetic piece of music is the piano at the end of the scene, which plays an piece of music that manages to be tense and suspenseful.The suspenseful track tells the audience how they should feel about the audio recording. The use of non-diegetic sound at this point emphasizes that Harry Caul has finished his work.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nAn overall solid answer. Manages to answer the question well and includes a good example. Improvements could be made to explain more thoroughly how the emotional impact of the scene is actually modified or elevated."

            "question": "Choose one or more scenes from any anime and analyze different aspects of their visual production based on the categories above. (Bad Answer)",
            "answer": "I love the scene in Bambi, where Bambi is sliding on the ice. It\u2019s very well animated for its time, and the movement looks good. The background art looks good, and is very colorful. The character design is also detailed for its time, and looks very cute and expressive. The compositing looks good, because the different elements used for compositing goes well together in this scene, making it look natural. The storyboarding is also good, since the comedic timing of Bambi falling is well timed. This is all the reasons why Bambi looks so good.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThe writeup contains a severe lack of actual analysis, only that the film is well animated with good background art and character designs, without elaborating on why or how. There are no actual examples or scene descriptions. It mentions why the compositing looks good but that mostly boils down to \u201Cbecause it is.\u201D"

            "answer": "Perhaps no live-action franchise is as well known for its openings as the Bames Jond franchise. The opening of Casino Royale (You Know My Name, by Chris Cornell) is an example of such an opening. During this opening, there are card symbols. The opening starts with james bond shooting the camera, and james bond loading a gun with a spade. James bond fires the gun. We then see multiple guns fire and someone gets shot. James Bond then fights someone with a knife, punches someone in the face, and pushes someone off of the ledge. Then we see James Bond fighting multiple people. After that, there's crosshairs and someone gets shot by them. We then see other people get shot and James Bond runs and strikes a pose. This is a good opening.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the opening to the film The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (featuring the song The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly by Ennio Morricone) is extremely iconic. The opening has cannon fire during it. This opening has a very famous song, that is instantly recognizable. The opening consists of pictures of characters from the movie. If you know anything about the west, you would recognize this popular and well-known song, and instantly know why it is an excellent piece of music. This is a good opening but for different reasons.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThis writeup does not actually analyze anything. The first paragraph just describes what the opening contains without any further thought. The second paragraph uses no actual reasoning except that the song is famous."

            "question": "Name an anime you enjoyed that is not in your favorite genre(s). What made it stand out? (Bad Answer)",
            "answer": "I tend to stray away from computer animated kiddy films, but Dreamworks' Shrek caught my attention one summer's day. I was soon about to find out that Shrek would soon land in my top 5 movies of all time list.\r\n\r\nShrek is an ogre who simply wishes for peace and quiet, but does not get that, and instead has his swamp invaded by fairy tail creatures who were banished there by a corrupt lord (hate him by the way). Shrek makes a deal with the Lord to regain control of his swamp in return for saving a princess whom he intends to marry. With the help of a donkey (Eddie Murphy is funny here), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, not realizing that she's hiding a secret that will change his life forever.\r\n\r\nJust from the synopsis you can tell you're in for quite a ride, and the movie is jam packed with clever jokes, solid animation, and a neat soundtrack (smash mouth is a good band that is still very relevant today).\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThis writeup does name a piece of media not in their favourite genre, but doesn\u2019t actually elaborate on what made it stand out. The second paragraph is just a synopsis, while the third describes what they like about the movie too briefly. The claims need to be backed up, preferably with examples, and most importantly the writeup needs to tell us why this specific movie stands out among other \u201Canimated kiddy films.\u201D"

            "answer": "Sokka from Avatar the Last Airbender is a bad character. He can\u2019t bend elements, and is mainly there to tell jokes, since it\u2019s a kids show. The show would be more serious and good, if Sokka was removed.\r\n\r\nI would improve him as a character, by making him a weapon expert. He could use different weapons, not just boomerang, but also samurai swords and shuriken's. It doesn\u2019t make sense that he\u2019s clever but act stupid, so I'd make him act less stupid. Maybe he could tell insightful qoutes, like master Iroh and support the party in clever ways, instead of being acting stupid. Since he\u2019s smart, he should use science as a weapon more often. It would be cool if he created weapons from our time, to fight against the fire nation. I think Sokka should be more like Doctor Stone.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThe writeup addresses issues in a very superficial manner and never elaborates on the actual character\u2019s writing with examples. The improvements are similarly shallow and are not defended very well with any deeper analysis."

            "answer": "Robin Williams was the voice of my childhood, as I\u2019m sure he was for many others my age, but no more prominently than in Aladdin as the Genie. Even watching the movie now years later, I\u2019m still as captivated and enthralled as I was when I was a kid.\r\n\r\nAladdin would simply not be the same movie without his performance, and he outshines everyone else in the cast with his comedic timing in every scene he\u2019s in (except possibly in singing ability, given that this was right before the turning point of when animated films prioritized celebrities and name-recognition over vocal talent, and actually hired Broadway-level talent for their musicals). He can also pull on your heart strings when its a more quiet, serious moment. He brings an zany energy that perfectly matches the animation for a performance that\u2019s difficult to match and impossible to forget.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nThe write-up does not answer the question and only uses vague, broad generalizations to defend their topic. Both the actual performance and any brief examples are described in a superficial way. There is also an unnecessary random tangent about casting that not only isn\u2019t needed in a relatively short answer, but elaborates on a counterpoint to their argument, instead of a defense."
