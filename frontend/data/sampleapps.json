            "answer": "Dunkirk and 1917 are two war dramas which rely on building tension through the passage of time, the viewer knowing that every second passing is a step closer to an unfortunate end. They are both exceptional at utilizing different tricks to create a sense of dread in the audience, the deadline ever approaching as the film goes on, but while they both excel at this, they each do it in a different way.\r\n\r\n The thing that contributes most to 1917’s tension (and something that it has that Dunkirk lacks) is its central gimmick, the illusion of a constant timeline without camera cutaways. The protagonist has until the next morning to deliver this letter or his allies and his family fall into a trap and die, and so the film takes us along with him every step of the way, a constant sense of progression being instilled in us as we see him move forward every step, as well as the lighting and timing change as the day goes by. We pretty much never separate from him, and so it becomes all the more worrisome every time he meets with a setback bringing him to a halt and we see the time change in how the sky is lit, the biggest example of this being when he gets shot and passes out in a house in enemy territory. The sudden shift from day to night from when he passes out to when he wakes up sent chills down my spine as I realized how much time had passed, and the panic was perfectly conveyed both in the character and in the buildup of dread in the film. Suddenly everything is pitch black with harsh flames scattered throughout, and the character is frantically trying to escape towards his destination. All of this serves the tone and tense atmosphere beautifully, and this constant sense of progression achieved by the camera work and lighting is a step above Dunkirk’s. \r\n\r\nDunkirk’s key tool in building its tense atmosphere is in its audio, a place where it far surpasses that of 1917. Dunkirk’s sound design and soundtrack get the heart pounding and the brow sweating. Whether in oppressive silence or thundering noise, what you can hear in every moment is thoughtfully chosen to maintain and escalate the atmosphere. Of course, there are loud noises such as gunshots or cannon fire, which are well timed and utilized to keep the viewer on their toes, crashes of bombs and the hums of planes blaring as soldiers panic and run. What I found most impressive though was how tight my chest felt even in the silent moments, the direction making the audience fully aware of how terrible the situation was even without the blaring sounds. Most of the tracks feature tense strings, a heavy bass, and/or pounding drums, often increasing speed as the situation progresses, making the viewer feel the suffocation of the soldiers stranded on the beach. Instead of the single perspective, we follow a variety of different people as they work towards their individual solutions and face different challenges, the ambience changing for each in their own way, whether they’re on the beach, at the docks back home, on a ship at sea,or in a plane above it all, but that soundtrack keeps them all united, instilling an anxiety that doesn’t go away until the end. \r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n3/4. Introduces the two films and talks about why they are similar. Then very succinctly goes into what each film does better with good analysis in each paragraph. None of the analysis is particularly striking but it’s solid and concise. There’s general good description on what the effect on the camerawork and sound design respectively achieves for the film’s purpose."

            "question": "(Good Answer)Name a character you enjoyed that did not change over the course of the show. Explain why you enjoyed that character.",
            "answer": "There are many things that could be said about Eric Cartman and his portrayal in South Park, but one fact is rather inarguable - he's a fairly static character who barely changes throughout the series. Let's try to see why it only benefits the series. \r\n\r\nSouth Park, in general, is a satirical comedy that locks its characters in a loop - while the world and events surrounding the characters change, they themselves remain the same. This is done for a reason - the characters stay familiar for the audience, and their personas react to the new \"problems\" that the story throws at them every standalone episode. Among these characters, Eric Cartman might be the most famous and important. The cornerstone of the main cast, he's lazy, prejudiced, narcissistic and insensitive, if not downright psychopathic. He is a rather unlikeable character, to say the least. Yet still, he's incredibly popular - mostly because he gives the best and most memorable reactions to the events that usually mirror the real world news. It is possible to achieve because he is consistent and static in his views, and viewers want to see his, Eric Cartman's, responses and laugh at them. Was he changing in some way it would be harder to nail down his world outlook, and in this kind of exaggerated parody of it all that South Park is it is especially important to have characters who measure up by being equally ridiculous and at the same time somewhat relatable. \r\n\r\nAs to why I enjoyed Eric Cartman and his character, it's because of so many mischievous (and often criminal) things go through his head and turn everything upside down, throwing plot of any given episode in a completely new direction. While he's a terrible human being who has no plans to change whatsoever, it doesn't matter all that much because his character achieves the goal of being an asshole who reacts to things in a hysterical manner. And what a fun asshole he is - certainly South Park would lose a lot without Eric Cartman's antics, his disrespect of all and everyone and constant scheming. Characters like him are needed - if only to reflect a bit on the world around us and feel a bit better that we're not like Eric Cartman. We're not, right?\r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 3/4. Solid answer that both justifies the benefits of Cartman being a static character, the effect of him being static, and how much this benefits the show. There’s a clear line throughout the reasoning and the analysis of his character is good. The final statement is also great. An example here or there or perhaps some deeper analysis into his mind and relationship with the rest of the characters could push this into a 4/4."

            "question": "(Good Answer)Pick one visual production aspect from the following list: Animation, Background Art, Character Design, or Cinematography. Talk about two anime that manage to succeed at this aspect in different ways.",
            "answer": "The Secret of Kells and The Triplets of Belleville excel in many aspects of visual production, but none more so than character design. Both films have character designs that work in tandem with the settings and inspirations for their worlds. The Secret of Kells is an 8th century tale set in Ireland that was inspired by many works of art, but most importantly Irish folktales and Illuminations. Thus, the designs of the characters take on elements of said Illuminations and Irish art. The characters are minimalist, lacking in complex shapes and volume. Normally, character designs tend to include elements suck as folds in clothing and foreshortening to give the characters a three-dimensional feeling. However, the characters in The Secret of Kells avoid this in favor of a more graphic style that accurately portrays the Illuminations it takes inspiration from. If the characters are foreshortened, it uses simple, flat shapes to do so. Its character silhouettes are also simple, and the characters all include a wealth of tangent and parallel lines, another aspect that helps the characters feel flat and like moving medieval mosaics in a storybook. Dynamics between characters are indicated by height, with the tallest character, the Abbot, also carrying on a somewhat antagonistic role towards the protagonist Aidan while also indicating his importance in the town of Kells. The vikings similarly are drawn large and monstrously to display their at a glance how they are the bad guys. In contrast, when Aidan visits the woods, the line work of the wolves contrasts with that of his uncle Abbot, with the wolves utilizing mostly curved lines in their design.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, The Triplets of Belleville's designs also take inspiration from its setting. This film takes place in a 1950s Paris and opens with an old performance of The Triplets of Belleville in a surreal Fliescher-like style. This style helps indicate to the audience that the scene the main characters are watching on television was filmed many years ago. Meanwhile, the designs of the characters in the present day have a caricatural realism to them. Since the film has no dialogue, it relies solely on its visuals and music to tell its story. Thus, aspects of the character designs are exaggerated so the emotions are more easily conveyed, namely the eyes, noses, and body shape. The linework on the characters is thick and dark, and is thus also able to preserve a graphic style like one would see in a Mad Magazine in the 60s. Lastly, the most exciting aspect of these characters is the way they are able to morph their silhouettes together. Namely, the rectangular men in black who antagonize the main characters, when they stand next to each other, can transform into one menacing wall. This design is later referenced in a joking matter when the triplets, Bruno, and Souza all don the same black coat and become one rectangular blob with heads sticking out at all ends.\r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 3/4. Includes the inspiration, reasoning, and effect of both types of character designs and the effect it has on the two different works. The reasoning for each design is analysed and explained, and each is woven into the setting. The second paragraph is quite a bit stronger than the first, the latter having somewhat simple design analysis. Elevating the two different analysis to the same height would give this a 4/4."

            "question": "(Good Answer)What anime is improved massively by its soundtrack or voice actor(s). Why?",
            "answer": "Phineas & Ferb is an episodic show about two brothers who decide to enjoy their summer vacation to the fullest by doing something cool every day. The show is built around a strict formula - every episode the boys come up with a crazy idea, their sister wows to tell on them to their mom, and their pet platypus sneaks out to battle the evil scientist Dr Doofenshmirtz. With only 10 minutes per episode and many fixed components that need to be squeezed in, it’s tough to make every episode be unique and memorable.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s where the soundtrack comes in. The basis is of it are songs that establish general tone of the show - generally fun, carefree and excited, such as the famous Quirky Worky Song that uses the combination of scatting, banjo, some wind instruments and various percussions to achieve its quirky, positive vibe. The next layer are repeated theme songs - such as the ones of Perry the Platypus’ and Doofenshmirtz that are played or referenced in some form every episode. Once the audience is familiar with them, the show starts playing around by slightly changing lyrics or arrangement, or setting up a diegetic context for them by revealing that someone actually played or heard them within the world. This way the music is congruent with how the show plays with its formulas, keeping them mostly the same but doing small twists and changes. \r\n\r\n However, there is one big thing that changes every episode, and that is the activity that Phineas & Ferb dedicate their day to. It largely determines the setting of the episode, whether it will be something urban, historic, fantastical, science-fiction and so on. As the time to establish the setting and activity is very short, what helps immensely are the insert songs. For the most part they are just simple songs with lyrics relating to the episode in some way, elaborating on the setting or activity, describing the events as they happen or selling the viewer on the central element of the episode. But a great choice is that all of these songs are in a different musical genre, jumping all around eras and styles in search for the perfect fit for each episode, not afraid to create interesting mashups or subvert conventions either. As such the wonder of “what kind of song will this episode have” mirrors the childish wonder of wondering what Phineas and Ferb will do today, and the songs are as elaborate and well crafted as their projects. As such the show not only offers the (often young) viewer a chance to discover a lot of different areas of creativity, but also a lot of kinds of music that they can get into.\r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 3/4. The description of how the repeated theme songs are slightly twisted each episode is good, but doesn’t point out exactly what the effect is or how it actively makes the show better. The answer manages to climb to a 3 in the final part of the last paragraph, where genre/style argument brings up solid points. A bit more analysis into the direct effect of the songs, especially in terms of examples, would bring this to a more solid 3 or perhaps a 4."

            "question": "(Good Answer)Analyse the following anime OP. You can be as negative and positive as you want as long as you defend your opinion. Be sure to include both visual and auditory aspects in your analysis. [Biker Mice From Mars OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8vpeDEOII4)",
            "answer": "This is a really interesting opening. I will analyse this in terms of how the music and visuals communicates what the show is about, at least in my own belief.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the title of this show is “Biker Mice From Mars” which already sounds very over-the-top and silly, but we have had serious Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoons, so it’s not a write-off just yet. The first 10 seconds give us a brief look at the title, then Mars, then Biker Mars. Very apt. I think the guitar riff coupled with the mice smashing out of a building tells us what to expect: Over-the-top action. A brief shot of what looks like a mad scientists tells us that the tower, the mice broke through, was likely the laboratory they were created in, and that they are now being chased for escaping. \r\n\r\nA chase scene that has the mice enter Chicago makes it clear that they somehow traveled *from* Mars and to Earth, with the following shot establishing the purple suited dude as the big bad. We also saw this man on Mars, so he’s likely their “creator” to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this point, the OP mostly establishes the premise. It introduces us to the main characters, the setting (Chicago), and the central conflict, the mice being chased by the bad dude. The rest of the opening then gives us a sort of summary of how the show is gonna be, as well as a look into its tone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago is shown to be a ruined wasteland. You could argue that that’s just how Chicago looks, but I’d say it’s probably some dystopian future setting.Contrasting the “dark” setting are the mice radically jumping over a hole and the blue one sitting cross-legged all smug on his motorcycle. This tells us that despite the setting and background, this is gonna be a l laid-back not very serious show, or that the mice themselves aren’t taking it seriously at least, which is accentuated by the guitar riff in the background. \r\n\r\nChicago is shown to be a ruined wasteland. You could argue that that’s just how Chicago looks, but I’d say it’s probably some dystopian future setting.Contrasting the “dark” setting are the mice radically jumping over a hole and the blue one sitting cross-legged all smug on his motorcycle. This tells us that despite the setting and background, this is gonna be a l laid-back not very serious show, or that the mice themselves aren’t taking it seriously at least, which is accentuated by the guitar riff in the background. \r\n\r\nIn very typical saturday-morning style, the mice continue to do radical stunts and showing off, culminating in a gnarly explosion and the reveal that the purple-suited dude is actually an alien (likely from Mars??). It ends with the mice “saving the girl” in a damsel-in-distress situation. The girl being saved in the end feels like sort of an afterthought of all the chaos and carnage and points us towards what I think is the main point the OP tries to illustrate. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I think everything in this OP points towards satire of the “saturday morning cartoon” genre. We have “big bad dystopian city”, evil alien, escaped mutants, damsel in distress, and our three colorcoded heroes. It almost blasts through what a typical episode would look like in a single minute. But the music track, the fact that these are “Biker Mice” which combines something typically badass and typically timid, and the complete over-the-top blasé attitude of the mice and the opening as a whole communicates very well that this is meant to be a comedic action show that satirizes saturday morning cartoons. Maybe. Or maybe it’s just a regular action cartoon. \r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n3/4 Applicant does a great job at trying to delve into the general vibe of the OP and try to figure out what the show is about from just a minute of content. Going further into detail on the OP’s production itself would have been nice, rather than just scratching the surface, but this person clearly has a solid understanding of how to analyze something. Could have done with less “summary” though."

            "answer": "‘The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes’ is significantly better than ‘Avengers Assemble’. It is faithful to the comic books whereas the latter is choosing to follow the MCU movies in how it looks and tells its stories. The comic book stories have significantly more maturity and depth to them, and the designs used are sleek and cool-looking. In contrast, the MCU movies are mainstream and appeal to young viewers, losing that maturity. The designs in Avengers also end up suffering because of this. \r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 1/4 Why does being more mature make it automatically better? It’s an extremely subjective point to try and sell to graders, so it’s far easier to talk about how it handles similar plot points, pacing, character-focused stories, how it looks etc. It also fails to do the “vice versa” part of the question."

She doesn’t change too much across the movies, but she’s good enough to make the action and scares in the films fun.\r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 1/4 Technically answers the question with “she’s badass”.

            "answer": "“Masha i volshebnoe varene” and “Nasledstvo volshebnika Bakhrama” are two soviet cartoons from the 70s that have really great background art. Masha has really cute and lighthearted watercolor backgrounds, that make the short feel very fun, lighthearted, and childlike, which is fitting because it is a cartoon for children. On the other hand, Nasledstvo is the complete opposite. The backgrounds are very dark with muddy colors like brown and grey, I’m not sure if they are watercolors, though. It gives the whole thing a very dark vibe, which is also very fitting as the short takes place underground!\r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 1/4 Technically answers the question, but has no real points raised. It doesn’t say why these two shows succeeded at the aspect, just that those aspects exist. “It has watercolor” and “it’s very dark” with such a flimsy explanation does not cut it."

            "answer": "Dear Evan Hansen is a lovely musical, and its soundtrack absolutely bangs. There are some really upbeat songs with fun lyrics. My favorite one is Sincerely Me and it’s about how they write fake emails that depict Evan Hansen having a friendship with this kid who died, and it’s very funny and has a lot of dark humor. Some of the songs on depression are well-written and communicate very deep themes on depression. I find them really relatable, and Dear Evan Hansen, at its best, really speaks to me. While the movie would be okay without the songs, it’s really how masterfully the songs are written and composed that elevate the movie into one of my favorites of all time.\r\n\r\n**Grade** \r\n\r\n 1/4 This fundamentally does not answer *why* Dear Evan Hansen is elevated by its soundtrack.
