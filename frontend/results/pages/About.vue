                                    The /r/anime Awards, this website and the Awards Livestream are a labor of love made possible through the many volunteers involved in the entire process.

                                    We’d like to start by thanking /u/commandersevan, /u/eritbh, /u/JoseiToAoiTori and /u/PandavengerX for their work in creating this website and for putting up with unending changes, edits, and last-minute requests. We would also like to thank them for their work on the websites for juror applications, initial voting, final voting and the internal website used by hosts and /r/anime moderators to manage the Awards and see results.

                                    We’d like to thank all of our livestream guests for agreeing to be a part of this year’s most ambitious endeavor. You all have plenty of your own work but you were willing to help in making our results discussion more varied and insightful. We hope it was a pleasant rather than taxing experience!

The fact that he is also rumored to be the WORLD FAMOUS YOUTUBER KAMIMASHITA is just icing on the cake.

                                   The true soul of the r/Anime Awards is the evaluation of each year’s anime, and from the jury side of things it is not an easy task. We want to thank all of the 90+ jurors who signed up to watch, discuss, and write about the enormous number of selections available this year. It was a blast to work with all of them and we hope to see some familiar faces apply again next year!
