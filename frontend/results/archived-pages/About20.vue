                                    The /r/anime Awards, this website and the Awards Livestream are a labor of love made possible through the many volunteers involved in the entire process.

We would also like to thank them for their work on the websites for juror applications, initial voting, final voting and the internal website used by hosts and /r/anime moderators to manage the Awards and see results.

You all have plenty of your own work but you were willing to help in making our results discussion more varied and insightful. We hope it was a pleasant rather than taxing experience!

                                    We’d like to thank /u/drjwilson specifically for being willing to take up the monumental task of livestream host, along with all of the coordinating, behind-the-scenes work, and stamina that the role involves. The fact that he is also rumored to be the WORLD FAMOUS YOUTUBER KAMIMASHITA is just icing on the cake.

Our editors were: /u/DrJWilson, /u/irvom, /u/Jonlxh, /u/Theleux, /u/unprecedentedwolf and /u/Vaxivop. /u/blazofgold, /u/Cryzzalis, /u/Totalenlo and /u/WinzKay did voice-overs while /u/ATargetFinderScrub, /u/Combo33, /u/Master_of_Ares, /u/Ralon17 and /u/PandavengerX did clipping. We'd also like to thank /u/steamytomato for making the cute artwork of the anime awards snoo and /u/commandersevan for making the animations.

                                   We’re thankful to the moderators of r/anime for their support and in many cases active cooperation with something as involved as the awards.

                                   We’re also very appreciative of the users who committed to hosting this year. Planning for the awards is an almost year-long process, and once the jurors are invited, it only becomes more intense. From writing threads, evaluating applications, and assigning categories to moderating discussion, interfacing between different groups of people, and everything else, being a host took a lot of work. Thank you /u/ATargetFinderScrub, /u/Itz_Skiddlez, /u/JoseiToAoiTori, /u/KitKat1721, /u/Miidas-92, /u/PandavengerX, /u/Ralon17, /u/reyae, /u/rusticks, /u/RX-Nota-II, /u/TigerK3 and /u/Vaxivop.

                                   The true soul of the r/Anime Awards is the evaluation of each year’s anime, and from the jury side of things it is not an easy task. We want to thank all of the 90+ jurors who signed up to watch, discuss, and write about the enormous number of selections available this year. It was a blast to work with all of them and we hope to see some familiar faces apply again next year!
