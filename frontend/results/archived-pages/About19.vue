                                    We’d like to start by thanking /u/commandersevan, /u/eritbh, /u/JoseiToAoiTori and /u/PandavengerX for their work in creating this website and for putting up with unending changes, edits, and last-minute requests. We would also like to thank them for their work on the website used for the nomination process as well as the internal site for the awards used by hosts and /r/anime moderators.

                                    We’d like to thank all of our livestream guests for agreeing to be a part of this year’s most ambitious endeavor. You all have plenty of your own work but you were willing to help in making our results discussion more varied and insightful. We hope it was a pleasant rather than taxing experience!

The fact that he is also rumored to be the WORLD FAMOUS YOUTUBER KAMIMASHITA is just icing on the cake.

Our editors were: /u/clerikal, /u/Irvom, /u/jonlxh, /u/JoseiToAoiTori, /u/Theleux, and /u/unprecedentedwolf.

Our write-up editors were: /u/Cacophon, /u/darcyfied, /u/FrenziedHero, /u/jonlxh, /u/JoseiToAoiTori, /u/Master_of_Ares, /u/NimitzH, /u/Ralon17, /u/reyae, /u/RX-Nota-II, /u/sfafreak, /u/SuperStarfox64, /u/Totalenlo, Acasualviewer, /u/RandomRedditorWithNo.

                                   We’re thankful to the moderators of the r/anime subreddit for their support and in many cases active cooperation with something as involved as the awards. Thank you to /u/FetchFrosh, /u/mpp00, /u/ShaKing807, /u/FAN_ROTOM_IS_SCARY, /u/Mage_of_Shadows and the rest of the mod team this last year!

                                   We’re also very appreciative of the users who committed to hosting this year. Planning for the awards is an almost year-long process, and once the jurors are invited it only becomes more intense. From writing threads, evaluating applications, and assigning categories to moderating discussion, interfacing between different groups of people, and everything else, being a host took a lot of work. Thank you /u/Aztecopi, /u/Cryzzalis, /u/drjwilson, /u/isrozzis, /u/MalacostracaFlame, /u/MetaSoshi9, /u/PandavengerX, /u/Patureau, /u/Raging_SEAn, /u/RHINN0 and /u/Vaxivop.

                                   The true soul of the r/Anime Awards is the evaluation of each year’s anime, and from the jury side of things it is not an easy task. We want to thank all of the 70+ jurors who signed up to watch, discuss, and write about the enormous number of selections available this year. It was a blast to work with all of them and we hope to see some familiar faces apply again next year!

                                   Earlier last year, Japan suffered the deadliest massacre in the country since World War II. This alone is an atrocious tragedy, but in addition to that, the victims were members of one of the community's most beloved studios, Kyoto Animation. I think we should take a moment of silence to reflect upon the incident, but not about the horrendous actions taken by the perpetrator.

                                   Rather, the outpouring of support that came as a result. The second the news broke, fans jumped at the opportunity to help in any way they could, setting up crowdfunding, sending messages of condolence, and even selling out KyoAni's online merch store. We will always keep in our hearts the 36 people that died that day. But also the fact that the community so completely rejected the hatred that led up to this tragic incident. Instead, a community that is so often divided, came together to embrace love. Please keep in mind that both Kyoto Animation, as well as the animation industry as a whole still require our continued support. Let us reflect.
